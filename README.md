# JUnit-with-Leaderboard

## Set Up
* Clone this repository into your local IDE (IntelliJ-IDEA or Eclipse).
* To run all JUnit tests in the `LeadershipBoard` test class:
  * click the green double-play button to the left of the class name
* To run an individual JUnit test:
  * click the green play button to the left of the test method signature

## Starter Code
If you would like to start from a blank template, we have a `Leaderboard` interface you can implement in regular Java code.
* Create a file in the `.main` folder to implement a `LeaderboardImpl` class (though feel free to rename however you want)!
* Refer to the interface code comments for class logic!
* You can write helper methods or structure your code however you normally do. 

If you don't want the extra practice of reviewing Java code syntax and **skip straight to exploring JUnit**, we've provided a solution class that implements the `Leaderboard` interface for you (`Scoreboard`).

## JUnit Code
* 


1. Initialization
   What should the initial state of my program be?

2. Use Cases
   What should happen when I add/delete/reset scores normally?
   Does the top player score update correctly in these use cases?

3. Edge Cases
   What about adding a score when the board is full (capacity 5)?

   Updating a player's score?
   Deleting a score for a player that doesn't exist? Deleting when there are no players left?
